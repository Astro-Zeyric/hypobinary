## **introduction**

hypobinary is a **useless binary encoding experiment** created by **zeyric**.

it uses only two symbols:

- `-` → **0**
- `_` → **1**

nothing more.

hypobinary is **not efficient**, **not secure**, and **not practical**.  
it exists purely for **art code**, curiosity, pattern design, and building things that probably shouldn’t exist — but do anyway.

---

## **what is hypobinary**

hypobinary converts text into binary-like patterns using only `-` and `_`.

- characters are converted into binary values
- binary digits are mapped to symbols
- spaces and line breaks are preserved
- everything is intentionally minimal and human-made

this is **binary cosplay**, not real binary.

---

## **rules**

- `-` represents **0**
- `_` represents **1**
- characters are encoded in binary form
- spaces are explicitly preserved
- line breaks stay line breaks

simple rules. useless results.

---

## **example**

### input
hypo dev

### output
--- --- --__ -_ ---

(line breaks are preserved)

---

## **web encoder / decoder**

a simple web-based encoder and decoder is available:

🔗 **https://hypobinary.tiiny.site/**

features:
- encode normal text → hypobinary
- decode hypobinary → text
- preserves line breaks
- one-file html
- copy & clear buttons
- mobile + desktop friendly

---

## **why does this exist**

because:
- curiosity
- boredom
- pattern obsession
- art code
- no government approval required

---

## **roadmap**

- [x] basic mapping rules
- [x] web encoder / decoder
- [ ] hypobinary v2 experiments
- [ ] visual patterns
- [ ] logo & banner
- [ ] more useless ideas

## **contribute**

you can contribute if you want, but you don’t have to.

- fork it
- break it
- improve it
- or just stare at it
